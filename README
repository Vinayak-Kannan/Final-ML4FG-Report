Proposal Guidelines
The proposal should be between .5 * (1+N) and .5 * (2+N) pages for N team members. Your proposal should include:

1. What biological question will your method answer/enable answering? 

2. What ML method(s)/model(s) will you try using/developing? What ML method(s)/model(s) will you try using/developing? If using a supervised model what will the inputs/outputs be and how will they be represented? How will you assess performance [hint: straight accuracy is difficult to interpret because it depends on class imbalance, AUROC or even better auPR are preferable, or percent variance explained for regression tasks]? For unsupervised/generative models this is a more tricky question - imputation or a supervised task using the 

3. Where will you get data? What sample size is available (if appropriate)? What format is it in? What preprocessing (if any) will you need to do? 

4. Reference at least 3 highly relevant/related papers (arXiv/bioRxiv is fine). If you’re using Latex you should learn how to use bibtex/biblatex. In Google docs I recommend using Paperpile. These should be referenced as you would see in a paper, e.g. 
    Maurano, M. T. et al. Systematic localization of common disease-associated variation in regulatory DNA. Science 337, 1190–1195 (2012).
    (adding a link so we can look them up easily would also be helpful). 

5.  What are you planning to get done for the interim report, e.g. have downloaded, processed and understood the data, done some EDA, maybe run a baseline method or code from a related method. 

6. How will you assess performance compared to existing/baseline approaches? 

7. Come up with a title: ideally this would give some sense of the problem and the type of method you plan to use (e.g. “Predicting single-cell chromatin accessibility from sequence using convolutional neural networks”). It’s ok if you don’t know what method you’ll use in the end. 

We recommend writing proposals and final reports in Latex but this is not a requirement. We’d recommend using overleaf.com if you’re working in a team.
